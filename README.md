# LargestSquare

Find largest square in matrix of n*n

Current algorithm from: https://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/dynamic-programming-maximum-size-square-sub-matrix-with-all-1s/

Drawback this method:

- maximum matrix size is about 40000 * 40000

- is getting slow on larger matrixes

Improvement 1: Use boolean input matrix, byte temporary matrix
